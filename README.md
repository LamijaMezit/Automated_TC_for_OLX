# Automated_TC_for_OLX_

Testcase 2 (OLX_Search_TC_002)  Therefore, after we initialized driver, navigated to OLX’s Home Page URL, we sent keys (for the search term) through scripts to the search textbox and even pressed ‘Enter’ through automation script.
We then confirmed that the search term in fact returned results and finally closed the browser.
